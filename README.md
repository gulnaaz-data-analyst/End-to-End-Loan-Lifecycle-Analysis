## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Applications:** 3+ lakh borrowers, total credit exposure of ₹184 billion.  
- **Default Rate:** ~8.07% overall; higher among <30 and >60 age groups.  
- **Education Impact:** Borrowers with lower education show higher default risk.  
- **Occupation:** Laborers, core staff, and “others” drive defaults; IT staff & managers are safer segments.  
- **Loan Size:** Most loans fall within ₹100K–₹500K range, also where defaults concentrate.

- **Implement financial literacy programs** for low-education applicants.  
- **Reassess risk pricing** for loans tied to high-default categories (e.g., mobile, furniture, consumer durables).  
- **Incentivize timely repayments** via cashback or lower interest for consistent payers.  
- **Monitor outliers** with unusually high annuity-to-credit ratios.  
- **Leverage unused credit capacity** (37.9% utilization) for cross-selling to reliable customers.
